# Non Mathematical Explanation: 
KNN stands for K Nearest Neighbors. It's a very basic, simple supervised learning classification algorithm. Here's the idea behind it: say you have a point that you want to classify into a class. So you're given some information about a point, say SAT score and GPA. You want to classify whether the student will get into school X or not. So what you do is you look at k (any number you choose, preferrably odd) people with similar scores and then take a vote. If you choose k = 5, then you look at 5 people with similar scores and see that 3 got in and 2 didn't, so you classify that point as "getting into the school". Obviously this isn't the most sophisticated algorithm out there but given how ridiculously simple it is, I find it to be a good starting point.
