# Motivation
This repository primarily servers to document my ML learning journey. Given that ML is a very vast field, I wanted to create a place where whatever I learn is organized by topic. 


# Introduction
This repository contains various aspects of ML such as algorithms, math, models and research paper summary/annotations. More info on how to use this repo will be updated continually. To see the contents of this repository, click on the relevant section under the topics tab of the readme. I'm a believer in the Feynman Technique so some of the topics covered here, if not all will have associated videos. I will try to make the algorithms as self contained as possible (although cross referecing with other material is recommended). The math however, will not be self contained (by the very nature of the subject). I will cover whatever I can and make it comprehensive to the best of my abilities but it's a good idea to read other sources. This repository is intended to serve as a starting point (not one stop shop) for what I've come across in my ML journey (and potentially provide a rough roadmap to anyone looking to start ML but isn't sure where to start) but there is a lot more to the field.  

I should note that some of these are eror prone as they're not reviewed by another set of eyes. If you happen to catch an error or have any suggestions, feel free to email me [here](aditya.iyer@berkeley.edu).  

I try to make the math notes easy to read on their own and as annotated as I can without writing a lot, but I think they're best served as a side dish along with the corresponding youtube videos.
