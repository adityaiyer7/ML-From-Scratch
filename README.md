# Motivation
This repository primarily servers to document my ML learning journey. Given that ML is a very vast field, I wanted to create a place where whatever I learn is organized by topic. 


# Introduction
This repository contains various aspects of ML such as algorithms, math, models and research paper summary/annotations. More info on how to use this repo will be updated continually. To see the contents of this repository, click on the relevant section under the topics tab of the readme. I'm a believer in the Feynman Technique so some of the topics covered here, if not all will have associated videos. I will try to make the algorithms as self contained as possible (although cross referecing with other material is recommended). The math however, will not be self contained (by the very nature of the subject). I will cover whatever I can and make it comprehensive to the best of my abilities but you it's a good idea to read other sources. These are more to serve as a starting point for what I've come across in my ML journey but there is a lot more to it.
