# Motivation
This repository primarily servers to document my ML learning journey. Given that ML is a very vast field, I wanted to create a place where whatever I learn is organized by topic. 


# Introduction
This repository contains various aspects of ML such as algorithms, math, models and research paper summary/annotations. More info on how to use this repo will be updated continually. To see the contents of this repository, click on the relevant section under the topics tab of the readme. I'm a believer in the Feynman Technique so some of the topics covered here, if not all will have associated videos.
